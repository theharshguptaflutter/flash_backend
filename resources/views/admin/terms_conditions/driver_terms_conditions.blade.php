          </li>
          <li><strong>SUBSCRIPTION FEE, TRIP FEES AND ANCILLARY</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Flash operates on a “pay as you use” basis, and thus allows you to <u>utilise</u> our Services in exchange for the payment of the Subscription Fee per day that you provide the Transportation Services with at least one completed Trip through Flash App. The Subscription Fee is debited on a weekly basis and shall commence from the first day that the Driver has worked; and is <strong>calculated</strong> as follows, either in the amount of: -
                <ol>
                  <li>A flat rate of R 50.00 (fifty rand) per day should total Trip fees generated on any given day be equal to R 500.00 (five hundred) or more; or,</li>
                  <li>10% (ten percent) of the total Trip fees generated on any given day should the total Trip fees generated on any that day accumulate to an amount less than R 500.00 (five hundred rand).</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Any delay....</strong> in payment of the Subscription Fee may attract a penalty charge that Flash shall determine from time to time on the App.</li>
              <li>The Passenger has the option of selecting from two payment methods for purposes of making payment of the Passenger Fare to Driver. Payment may be effected to Driver either by way of the Flash In-App Payment method processed though Flash App by our third-party payment provider, or the Passenger may select a <strong>cash...</strong> payment directly to you.</li>
              <li>Drivers, similarly, may opt to provide Transportation Service exclusively for Flash In-App Payment or cash payments, alternatively both.</li>
              <li>The Flash In-App Payment method is seamlessly integrated into Flash App and upon receipt of the payment instruction the total Passenger Fare is debited from the Passengers linked bank account upon completion <strong>[or commencement?]</strong> of the Trip.  Flash In-App Payment services may attract additional taxes and charges including but not limited to, third-party payment costs, bank charges, income tax, and Flash is not responsible for any such additional <u>transactional</u> costs and/or taxes.</li>
              <li>Using Flash’s In-App Payment service requires Flash to act as a commercial agent to Drivers providing Transportation Services. You hereby <u>authorise</u> Flash to act in limited commercial capacity as your agent for the collection of Passenger Fares, and/or additional costs, as payment for Trips from a User’s nominated bank account and on payment to you. Any further charges and taxes that may be due in addition to the Subscription Fee, such as third-party payment costs at an additional charge of 0.25% (zero point two five percent) of the total transaction value per transaction, will be for your account and deducted from the total fees due to you at the end of each week.</li>
              <li>Charges and costs applicable for the use of the third-party payment provider are calculated per transaction and debited against the Driver’s Flash Account, as determined from time to time by Flash.</li>
              <li>Should the User elect to pay the Driver in <strong>cash...</strong>,, the Driver is required to tender the correct change to the User, alternatively, accept the cash amount, record this transaction on Flash App and request Flash to provide a credit amount against the User’s Account. <strong>Should the User...</strong> fail to make a cash payment after completion of a Trip, and upon your notification to Flash via Flash App, Flash will notify the User of a failure to pay. Should the User provide a just and equitable reason for failure to pay, Flash is under no obligation to compensate you for your expenses incurred. </li>
              <li>The Passenger’s payment obligation is owed to you and shall be discharged upon Flash’s receipt of the payment instruction to make payment of the Passenger Fare to our bank account via the Flash In-App Payment process. Flash shall receive all Passenger payments and then pay over the aggregate weekly total of Passenger Fares collected on your behalf less the Subscription Fee and ancillary charges, to your nominated bank account at the end of each working week. </li>
              <li>The Passenger Fare estimation is calculated through the Flash App automated means of mapping the anticipated route. A final Passenger Fare is determined upon drop-off of the Passenger at the inserted destination. However, this final fee may include, but are not limited to, certain ancillary costs such as high-demand surcharges, booking fees and tolls. Flash reserves the right to adjust the total fee and/or any other costs insofar as it is just and equitable to do so.</li>
              <li>At the completion of the Trip, a Passenger has the discretion of tipping you a gratuity at an additional cost through the Flash App or in cash. You will receive 100% (one hundred percent) of all tips, excluding any relevant charges and taxes that may be applicable. However, Flash expressly reserves its right to withhold the provision of any tips to any Driver should it suspect that the payment of the tip is unlawful.</li>
              <li>In the event that an electronic payment option is selected, Flash is <u>authorised</u> by the Driver to accept payments from the User in order to tender such payment to the Driver. In line with the provision of services rendered by the Driver, a User’s obligations will be discharged upon successful payment of the Passenger Fare where the instruction has been given for the transfer of funds electronically through the Flash In-App Payment successfully, or the <strong>correct amount...</strong> in cash has been tendered.</li>
              <li>From time to time, Flash may send promotional codes to Users for the application of a discount towards the Passenger Fare. In the event that the User applies such a discount to a Trip, the Driver will be entitled to receive the full value of the Passenger Fare that would ordinarily have been charged, <strong>Flash will compensate the Driver for the shortfall...</strong> as the Driver would ordinarily be entitled to receive.</li>
              <li>Upon completion of a Trip, Flash will issue a Trip receipt to the Driver and Passenger respectively. You hereby agree that we are entitled to include in this receipt, your personal information relating to the Trip, including, the motor vehicle and registration number, your full name and contact information. You agree that this receipt may be issued on your behalf. You will able to access your entire Trip history and relevant receipts on your Flash Account via the Flash App.</li>
              <li>Should the Driver have any queries or disputes relating to payments and fees, the Driver may contact Flash via email at <strong>email address....</strong> where Flash undertakes to attend to the issue as soon as reasonably possible.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>REQUESTING AND CANCELLING OF TRANSPORTATION SERVICES </strong>

              <li>You will notify the Passenger through Flash App of your arrival at the specified Passenger pick up location, <u>whereafter</u> you may charge you an additional fee for any time spent waiting for the Passenger before the Trip commences as determined according to the <strong>rates...</strong> on Flash App. Should the Passenger or any third person for whom the Transportation Service were ordered, fail to arrive at the Driver’s vehicle at the stipulated destination and time, the Trip shall be deemed to be <u>cancelled</u> after a period of <strong>eight minutes has lapsed....</strong> </li>
