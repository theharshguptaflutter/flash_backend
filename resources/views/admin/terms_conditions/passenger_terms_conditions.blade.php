            <ol>
              <li>The Terms contained herein must be read carefully before accessing or using Flash Services and you must ensure that you understand the nature of Flash Services and agree to these Terms before you may begin to use our Services.</li>
              <li>These Terms set out the general terms and conditions governing Passenger use of Flash Services, which services constitute an e-hailing technology platform enabling Passengers who use the Flash App or Flash Platform to request and arrange Transportation Services with independent Drivers registered on the Flash Platform; and inform you of the Terms on which you may make use of Flash Services.</li>
              <li>By <u>utilising</u> and/or accessing Flash Services through Flash App, Flash Platform or its Website, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these Terms, and agree to be contractually bound by these Terms.</li>

          <li><strong>USE OF THE FLASH APP</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Flash provides e-hailing online platform and technology-based mobile application services to users with the view to facilitate the connection between Drivers and Passengers, and Flash does not provide transportation services itself.</li>
              <li>Use of Flash Services though the Flash App enables Passengers to request and receive the Transportation Services from independent Drivers, by way of Flash Services connecting and facilitating the engagement between Passenger and Drivers who provide Transportation Services. </li>
              <li>Flash is <u>authorised</u> by Drivers to facilitate the relationship between the Driver and Passengers through the Flash App and Platform.</li>
              <li>To use Flash App, Passengers are required to register a Flash Account and upon successful registration on Flash App, the Passenger is able to enter a request for Transportation Services and select an appropriate service offering, namely: -
                <ol>
                  <li>Flash Standard Service;</li>
                  <li>Flash Plus Service; or,</li>
                  <li>Flash Premium Service.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                Flash App will search for an available Driver to attend to the request. Flash does not provide any Transportation Services, in and of itself.
              </li>
              <li>Thereafter, an available and willing Driver may accept the Passenger’s request for Transportation Services for a prior agreed estimated Passenger Fare calculated according to the integrated software of Flash App. At the moment of the Driver’s acceptance of the service request, the Driver and Passenger are deemed to have entered into a contractual agreement for the provision of the Transportation Services via Flash App.</li>
              <li>Flash is not responsible in any capacity for the <u>fulfilment</u> of the agreement entered into between the User and Driver. Consequently, Flash is not responsible for any dispute that may arise between the Passenger and Driver relating thereto or to the <u>nonfulfillment</u> of such agreement and/or Trip.</li>
              <li>Flash may allow Users to maintain a Flash Account for as long as the Passenger agrees, complies and accepts the Terms as set out herein, and as may be amended from time to time. Users who strictly adhere to these Terms, and comply with the Flash Privacy Policy and any other applicable Flash policies, may be granted a right to use Flash Services on a non-exclusive, royalty-free, and revocable basis. The right to use and/or access Flash App is <u>non-transferrable</u> and may be <u>cancelled</u> by Flash in accordance herewith.</li>
              <li>The Passenger undertakes in good faith to at all times remain respectful of Drivers and engage in the Transportation Services in a manner that is courteous, considerate and in the spirit of any <strong>Flash Passenger guidelines and policies......</strong></li>
              <li>Though Flash cannot guarantee the quality of Transportation Services provided by Drivers, we request that you notify us of any unpleasant or offensive experiences during your Trip.</li>
              <li>Upon the conclusion of a Trip, the Passenger will be prompted to complete a review of the Transportation Services rendered by the Driver. This allows Flash to consider your experience and provide feedback to the relevant Driver in performance of the Drivers obligations and services to you.</li>
              <li>Passengers, unless prior written permission to the contrary is obtained from Flash, are permitted to hold one Flash Account. You are solely responsible for the affairs of your Flash Account, notwithstanding that you may elect to request a Trip on behalf of another person and the conduct of that person, and you are required to ensure the safety and security of your Flash Account.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>DATA AND CHANGES TO PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>When you submit your registration on Flash App, you are required to enter your personal information, including your email address, mobile telephone number, physical address and/or relevant payment information for purposes of using the Flash In-App Payment. You may be required to validate your identity as well as your contact and payment information.</li>
              <li>Accordingly, you consent to Flash processing this information and agree at all times to maintain an accurate and up-to-date Flash Account profile reflecting your current contact information, physical address and/or relevant valid payment details.</li>
              <li>In the event that you fail to maintain complete and updated changes to the Flash Account, including but not limited to, any failure to update your valid payment information, attempting to use expired or invalid payment methods, may result in the restriction or termination of your use of and access to Flash Services.</li>
              <li>Flash will keep a record of the relevant data and information relating to the User’s Trip information and the Trip receipt reflecting such information and total Passenger Fare will be sent directly to the User’s chosen email address at the conclusion of the Trip.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>PAYMENT OF PASSENGER FARES AND USE OF PROMOTIONAL CODES</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>5.1.You have the option of selecting from two payment methods for purposes of making payment of the Passenger Fare to Driver. Payment may be effected to the Driver either by way of the Flash In-App Payment method processed though Flash App by our third-party payment provider, or you may select a <strong>cash......</strong> payment offer.</li>
              <li>The Flash In-App Payment method is seamlessly integrated into Flash App and upon receipt of the payment instruction the total Passenger Fare is debited from the Passengers linked bank account upon completion <strong>[or commencement?]...</strong> of the Trip.  Flash In-App Payment services may attract additional charges and taxes per transaction as third-party payment costs or bank charges, and Flash is not responsible for any such additional <u>transactional</u> costs.</li>
              <li>5.3.Using Flash’s In-App Payment service requires Flash to act as a commercial agent to Drivers providing Transportation Services. Your payment obligation is still owed to the Driver and shall be discharged upon receipt of the payment instruction to make payment of the Passenger Fare to our bank account via the Flash In-App Payment process. Flash shall receive your payment and then pay over such payment to the Driver. </li>
              <li>The Passenger remains solely responsible for ensuring that you maintain sufficient available funds and that payment in this manner is successfully effected through Flash In-App Payment.</li>
              <li>The Passenger Fare estimation is calculated through Flash App upon automated means of mapping the anticipated route. A final Passenger Fee is determined upon drop-off of the Passenger at your inserted end destination. <strong>However, this final fee may include, but are not limited to, certain ancillary costs such as high-demand surcharges, booking fees and tolls.</strong></li>
              <li>At the completion of your Trip, you have a discretion to tip your Driver a gratuity, in addition to the Passenger Fare, through the App or in cash. The Driver will receive and benefit 100% of the tip, excluding any relevant charges and taxes that may be applicable. However, Flash expressly reserves its right to withhold the provision of any tips to any Driver should it suspect that the payment of the tip is unlawful.</li>
              <li>In the event that the Flash In-App Payment option is selected, Flash is <u>authorised</u> by the Driver to accept such payments from the Passengers on the Drivers behalf and then tender such payment on to the relevant Driver.</li>
              <li>In line with the provision of Transportation Services rendered by the Driver, your obligations will only be discharged upon payment of the Passenger Fare where the payment instruction has been given for the transfer of funds electronically through Flash App successfully, or the correct amount in cash has been tendered to the Driver. As the Passenger, you undertake to ensure that you have sufficient funds, whether in cash or in your bank account, to fulfil your obligations to the Driver upon completion of the Trip.</li>
              <li>All Passenger Fares are due for payment immediately upon completion of the Trip and Flash will facilitate the payment using your preferred payment method selected for the Trip. To complete this process, Flash will send you the Trip invoice reflecting the Trip details via email.</li>
              <li>From time to time, Flash may offer promotional codes to Passengers for the application of a discount towards the Passenger Fare. If the Passenger Fare amount is greater than the amount discounted, the balance of the Passenger Fare will be allocated to your Trip and you will be liable for this payment via your chosen payment method.</li>
              <li>Only one promotional code may be <u>utilised</u> per Trip, and credited to one particular Trip without the option to redeem excess credit to another Trip.</li>
              <li>Flash is entitled to cancel any promotional code for whatsoever reason at any time.</li>
              <li>Should the Passenger have any queries or disputes relating to payments, the Passenger may contact Flash via email at <strong>email address where Flash undertakes to attend to the issue as soon as reasonably possible.....</strong>.</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
              <li>A Passengers request for Transportation Services is deemed to be placed and confirmed once a Driver has accepted such Passenger’s Trip request.</li>
              <li>Upon the confirmation of the Driver’s undertaking to provide the Transportation Services required to complete the Trip, the Passenger and Driver simultaneously enter into a contractual agreement for the provision of the Transportation Service in exchange for payment of the Passenger Fare.</li>
              <li>Flash is not a party to the contractual agreement created between you and the Driver as Flash does not provide any Transportation Services that may give rise to such obligations.</li>
              <li>In the event that a request for a Trip, which has been accepted by a Driver, is subsequently <u>cancelled</u>, rejected or refused by you, a penalty fee may be payable to the Driver if a period of <strong>five or more minutes...</strong> has elapsed since the time of the Drivers acceptance of the Trip request. The fee will be automatically debited from your nominated bank account associated with and linked to your Flash Account. </li>
              <li>Should the Driver elect to cancel a Trip after having accepted your Trip request, for whatever reason so arising, this risk shall be deemed to be borne by the Passenger and Flash will not be responsible for the <u>nonfulfillment</u> of any obligations arising from the agreement created between you and the Driver.</li>
              <li>You will be notified on Flash App of the Driver’s arrival at your specified Passenger pick up location, <u>whereafter</u> the Driver may charge you an additional fee for any time spent waiting for you before the Trip can commence as determined according to the <strong>rates....</strong> on Flash App. Should the Passenger or any third person for whom the Transportation Service were ordered, fail to arrive at the Driver’s vehicle at the stipulated destination and time, the Trip shall be deemed to be <u>cancelled</u> after a period of <strong>eight minutes has lapsed.....</strong> </li>

          <li><strong>ADDITIONAL PENALTY FEES</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>If, at any time during the provision of Transportation Services, the Passenger causes damage or proprietary harm to the Driver’s vehicle or its interior, the Driver may charge a penalty fee of <strong>up to R 5 000.00 (five thousand rand)...</strong> and require the Passenger to make payment of any damages exceeding such penalty.</li>
              <li>In the event that Flash receives an incident report relating to any damage to the Driver’s vehicle and/or property caused by you or resulting from the use of Flash Services on your Flash Account, Flash reserves the right to verify such incident report in its reasonable discretion and to facilitate payment from you for the reasonable cleaning costs or repair costs on behalf of the Driver.</li>
              <li>The Driver may cede such a claim for damages to Flash who may elect to pursue any such claim on the Driver’s behalf against the Passenger.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>LIABILITY </strong>
            <ol>
              <li>You agree that Flash shall not be liable for any consequential, indirect, incidental or special loss that may result from your use of Flash Services, even if you have advised us of the possibility of such loss. Consequential loss includes pure economic loss, loss of profit, loss of business and likely loss whether direct or indirect.</li>
              <li>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless against any loss, liability, cost, claim, action, demand or expense incurred or made against us in connection with the proper performance of your obligations except where that loss, liability, cost, claim, action, demand or expense arises from our negligence, fraud or willful default or that of our employees.</li>
              <li>Due to the nature of the Services that Flash provides, and despite Flash’s effort to ensure effective screening of competent and respectful Drivers, Flash cannot make any guarantees relating to the quality of the Driver’s provision of Transportation Services. As the Transportation Services depend on the quality and availability of the Drivers and their performance, Flash makes no guarantees in respect of such quality of performance or availability of Transportation Services.</li>
              <li>Flash Services do not provide for the brokerage of any transportation services, nor does we act as a provider, operator or an agency in respect of providing any transportation services.</li>
              <li>Our failure to seek redress for violations, or to insist upon strict performance, of any condition, or our failure to exercise any right or remedy to which we are entitled in these Terms, shall not constitute an implied waiver thereof.</li>
              <li>Flash shall not be liable for any loss or damage to property belonging to the Passenger whilst using the Transportation Services, or if left in the vehicle after completion of the Trip. In such instances, the Passenger shall notify Flash and contact the relevant Driver to arrange for the return of any such belongings, the costs whereof shall be for the Passengers account. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Flash and its officers, directors, employees and agents from all and any claims, losses, liabilities arising from or in connection to use of Flash Services.</li>
