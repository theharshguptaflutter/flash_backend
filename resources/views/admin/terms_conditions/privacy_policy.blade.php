          <h3><strong>How We Share Your Information</strong></h3>
          <p>We do not sell your personal information. To make the Flash Platform work, we may need to share your personal information with other users, third parties, and service providers. This section explains when and why we share your information.</p>
          <h4><strong>A. Sharing Between Flash Users <span>Riders and Drivers.</span></strong></h4>
          <p><i>Rider information shared with Driver:</i> Upon receiving a ride request, we share with the Driver the Rider’s pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup and during the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider’s destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Flash app. Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider’s rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Rider’s identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)</p>
          <p><i>Driver information shared with Rider: </i> Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will share with the Rider the Driver’s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in the Driver’s Flash profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Providing Driver loyalty and promotional programs;</li>
            <li>Providing marketing and advertising services to Flash;</li>
            <li>Providing financing;</li>
            <li>Providing requested emergency services;</li>
            <li>Providing analytics services to Flash; and</li>
            <li>Undertaking internal research to develop the Flash Platform.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4><strong>C. For Legal Reasons and to Protect the Flash Platform</strong></h4>
          <p>We may share your personal information in response to a legal obligation, or if we have determined that sharing your personal information is reasonably necessary or appropriate to:</p>

          <p>We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide you and our other users the Flash Platform. This means we keep your profile information for as long as you maintain an account. We retain <u>transactional</u> information such as rides and payments for at least seven years to ensure we can perform legitimate business functions, such as accounting for tax obligations. If you request account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in the “Deleting Your Account” section below.</p>
